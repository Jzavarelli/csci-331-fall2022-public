            The Brother's of Metal are a norse metal band that create <em>mythological</em> music. The band focuses on music that 
            is modern and well versed within the metal genre.

            The band is amazing and does not lean into the screaming portion of metal music. I enjoy their songs and would
            listen to certain albums for hours on end. You can listen to their music on their <a href="https://www.brothersofmetal.net/">Webpage</a>.
